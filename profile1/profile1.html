    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Greg, but my pack name is Bloodfang.  I never thought I'd be on one of these sites, but one of my friends met his packmate through here, so I figured why not give it a shot? <br>
I was born and raised in what is now Slovenia, until I was chased away by a bunch of peasants with pitchforks and torches.  Totally cliche, I know!  During my time running from the Hunters, I really fell in love with <br>
craft beer and skiing, so Denver seem like a natural place for me to wind up.  Plus, everyone knows that Hipsters taste the best!<br>
I'm searching for someone who would love to join me for skiing, a run, or chasing down a deer and eating its heart, but would be just as comfortable drinking beers on a patio.  I'm a huge fan of Denver's music scene, <br>
love to watch Broncos' games, and on occasion, go out and kill some Vampires. <br>
If you'd like to get to know me better, feel free to reach out!
    </p>
