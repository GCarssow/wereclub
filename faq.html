      <li><strong>1:  What is Were.Club?</strong> <br>
      Were.Club is the most exclusive dating site on the Internet.  Are you tired of having to keep making excuses for why you can't go out on the full moon?
    Tired of having to explain why you wake up covered in blood?  Or having to return silver jewelry that you received as a gift?  Were.Club is for you.  We cater <br>
  exclusively to Were-People, and provide dating advice to other creatures of the night.  Werewolves, Werebears, Werecats, and even Weregators, we can help you out. <br>
  Except for Werespiders.  Sorry, y'all are just too creepy.
</li>
<br>
  <li><strong>2:  How much does this service cost?</strong> <br>
  We understand that money can be tight, especially when your career options are limited by your bloodlust and inability to pull the night shift, which is why <br>
  we offer several payment options.  We are normally priced at $19.99 per month for a 12-month contract.  However, we also accept payment in fresh meat or Carpathian Gold.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>3:  What sort of events can I expect?</strong> <br>
  We have found that people tend to be most comfortable around their own kind, and thus we offer a number of exclusive events catered specifically to our members. <br>
  Just some of these events include: moon howlings, deer hunting, hiking, boar hunting, people hunting, cards against humanity, blood orgies, skiing/snowboarding trips, <br>
  sacrifice to Mordrogen, God of the Wild, and canvas and cocktails.
</li>
<br>
  <li><strong>4:  What happens if I don't find anyone? </strong><br>
    Then maybe you're the runt of the litter!  Haha, just kidding, a little Werewolf humor. <br>
    But seriously, we here at Were.club take our commitment to helping you find true love very seriously, and we're so sure that you'll find your true mate through our <br>
    service that we will offer you either six more months of time on the site, absolutely free, or one of the ancient Mesopotamian relics we keep in our vaults.  They make superb stocking stuffers <br>
    or coffee table conversation starters!

  <li><strong>5:  Do you offer services for Vampires? </strong> <br>
    Fuck Vampires.</li>
    <br>
  <li><strong>6:  Oh, so you guys are like Furries?</strong> <br>
    Get out.
