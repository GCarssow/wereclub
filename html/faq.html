        <strong class="faq-title">1:  What is Were.Club?</strong>
        <p>
          Were.Club is the most exclusive dating site on the Internet. Are you tired of having to keep making excuses for why you can't go out on the full moon? Tired of having to explain why you wake up covered
          in blood? Or having to return silver jewelry that you received as a gift? Were.Club is for you. We cater exclusively to Were-People, and provide dating advice to other creatures of the night. Werewolves, Werebears, Werecats, and even Weregators,
          we can help you out. Except for Werespiders. Sorry, y'all are just too creepy.

        <strong class="faq-title">2:  How much does this service cost?</strong>
        <p>
          We understand that money can be tight, especially when your career options are limited by your bloodlust and inability to pull the night shift, which is why we offer several payment
          options. We are normally priced at $19.99 per month for a 12-month contract. However, we also accept payment in fresh meat or Carpathian Gold.

        <strong class="faq-title">3:  What sort of events can I expect?</strong>
        <p>
          We have found that people tend to be most comfortable around their own kind, and thus we offer a number of exclusive events catered specifically to our members. Just some of these
          events include: moon howlings, deer hunting, hiking, boar hunting, people hunting, cards against humanity, blood orgies, skiing/snowboarding trips, sacrifice to Mordrogen, God of the Wild, and canvas and cocktails.

        <strong class="faq-title">4:  What happens if I don't find anyone? </strong>
        <p>
          Then maybe you're the runt of the litter! Haha, just kidding, a little Werewolf humor. But seriously, we here at Were.club take our commitment to helping you find true love very
          seriously, and we're so sure that you'll find your true mate through our service that we will offer you either six more months of time on the site, absolutely free, or one of the ancient Mesopotamian relics we keep in our vaults. They make
          superb stocking stuffers or coffee table conversation starters!
